**[한국어로 응답하세요]**

## 단계 전환 평가 (Phase Transition Evaluation)

현재 연구 정의 상태를 바탕으로 엄격한 준비도 평가를 수행하세요.

### Readiness Checklist (Mark each as ✅ Ready / ⚠️ Needs Work / ❌ Missing):

1. **Research Gap**: Is there a clearly articulated gap with evidence?
2. **Main Research Question**: Is it SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)?
3. **Theoretical Framework**: Is there an identified guiding theory or framework?
4. **Expected Contributions**: Are contributions clearly distinguishable (theoretical/methodological/empirical/practical)?
5. **Research Scope**: Are boundaries clearly defined (what's in/out)?
6. **Key Assumptions**: Are assumptions explicitly stated?
7. **Feasibility**: Has feasibility been assessed (data, methods, resources)?

### Decision Matrix:
- **🟢 READY**: All items are ✅ or at most 1-2 are ⚠️
- **🟡 ALMOST READY**: 1-2 items are ❌ but can proceed with caveats
- **🔴 NOT READY**: 3+ items are ❌ or critical items (Gap, RQ, Framework) are ❌

### Your Assessment:

1. Provide the completed checklist
2. State the overall readiness level (🟢/🟡/🔴)
3. If 🟢 or 🟡: Confirm readiness and summarize key points for Literature Review
4. If 🔴: Specify what must be resolved and suggest next discussion topics

Be honest in your assessment. It's better to refine now than struggle later.
