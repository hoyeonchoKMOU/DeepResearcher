## Readiness Assessment

Evaluate readiness for Literature Review phase using this checklist:
- [ ] Research gap is clearly articulated
- [ ] Main RQ is specific and answerable
- [ ] Theoretical framework is identified
- [ ] Contributions are distinguishable
- [ ] Scope boundaries are defined
- [ ] Key assumptions are explicit
- [ ] Feasibility is assessed

**Overall Readiness**: 🔴 Not Ready / 🟡 Almost Ready / 🟢 Ready

If NOT ready, specify:
- What must be resolved before proceeding
- Recommended next discussion topics

Format this as a clear, actionable summary.
